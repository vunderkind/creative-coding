# Follow along
I'm using the `canvas-sketch-cli` for this project, so you'll have to install it in your code editor to follow along. 

## Setup
1. Run `npm i canvas-sketch-cli` in your terminal. 
2. Create an empty folder. This is where your canvas sketch file will sit (a sketch.js file).
3. Create a new canvas sketch and open it by typing this into your terminal: `canvas-sketch sketch.js --new --open`

This should open your sketch.js file in the browser where you'll see a preconfigured Canvas with 2048 * 2048 dimensions. You can copy my sketch.js file to get started.
